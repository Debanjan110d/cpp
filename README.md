# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains my C++ programming practice and projects.

## Resources

### Official Documentation

- [Microsoft C++ Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/?view=msvc-170) - Comprehensive guide for C++ programming, including language features, STL, and best practices.

## Project Structure

- `test/` - Contains test programs and practice exercises
  - `hello.cpp` - Basic C++ programs
  - `hello2.cpp` - Additional practice programs

## Getting Started

To compile and run the C++ programs:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
2. Navigate to the program directory
3. Compile the program: `g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name`
4. Run the executable: `./program_name`

Note: Executable files (*.exe) are ignored in git commits as specified in the .gitignore file.
